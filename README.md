# Escola Project

This is a personal Django project designed for managing school-related data in a initial stage.

## Project Structure

- `escola/`: The main Django application directory.
  - `models.py`: Defines the database models (e.g., Student, Course).
  - `admin.py`: Configures the Django admin interface for the models.
  - `views.py`: Contains the view logic for handling requests.
  - `migrations/`: Stores database migration files generated by Django.
  - `tests.py`: Contains unit tests for the application.
  - `apps.py`: Application configuration.
  - `__init__.py`: Marks the directory as a Python package.
- `manage.py`: Django's command-line utility for administrative tasks. (Note: This file is assumed to exist based on standard Django structure, but wasn't listed in the initial file list).
- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
- `README.md`: This file, providing information about the project.

## Setup and Running

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python 3.x
    *   pip (Python package installer)

2.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd escola_Project
    ```

3.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    *   Assuming you have a `requirements.txt` file (if not, you'll need to install Django manually: `pip install django`):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *   *(If no `requirements.txt` exists, consider creating one: `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing Django)*

5.  **Apply database migrations:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6.  **Create a superuser (for accessing the admin panel):**
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    Follow the prompts to set up a username, email, and password.

7.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The application will typically be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. The admin panel is usually at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`.
